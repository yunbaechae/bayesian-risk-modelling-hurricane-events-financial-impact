# Bayesian Risk Modelling of Hurricane Events for Financial Impact Assessment

ACST3061 Actuarial Modelling Assignment 2 (2023)

This assignment applied Bayesian credibility theory to model hurricane frequency using Gamma-Poisson model. Focused on posterior estimation, credibility premium calculation, and financial impact for insurance products.

## Key Tasks
- Implemented Gamma-Poisson Bayesian model for hurricane frequency  
- Computed posterior distributions and credibility estimates  
- Assessed financial impact and pricing implications  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Bayesian credibility theory and Gamma-Poisson model  
- Posterior estimation and credibility premium calculation  
- Commercial application to insurance risk and pricing  

## Submission Details
